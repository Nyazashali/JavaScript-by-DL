     <!-- Key Points About Variables
  Declaration Keywords:
     let: Block-scoped and can be updated, but not redeclared in the same scope.
     const: Block-scoped, but cannot be updated or redeclared. Must be initialized when declared.
     var: Function-scoped, can be updated and redeclared, but less commonly used now due to scope issues.

  Naming Rules:
    Must start with a letter, _, or $.
    Cannot use reserved keywords (e.g., let, function).
    Case-sensitive (e.g., Name and name are different).

  Assigning Values:
    You assign values using the = operator. -->

    <script>
        console.log("Hello Javascript");

        // Variables

        let x = "John"; // string
       const y = 25;   // number
       var z = "New York"; //boolean
        console.log(x, y, z);

    </script>
